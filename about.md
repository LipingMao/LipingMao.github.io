Liping Mao

Glad to know someone can open this page. This blog is only for me to record something I learn. I'm a technical guy who is interested in Network, IaaS, Container.

For last 5 years, I worked around openstack from Folsom to Newton, I was ATC in neutron(sadly, not now). Recently, I work around Kuryr project as core developer.
If you are interested in me, just send me mail.
