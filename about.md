Liping Mao

Glad someone can open this page, I did not leave any place to let people give their comments or message as I do not like others comment on me, what a XXXX guy :-)
This blog is only for me to record something I learn. I'm a technical guy who is interested in Network, IaaS, Container.

For last 3 years, I worked around openstack from Folsom to Mitaka, I was ATC in neutron, recently I focus on Kuryr.
If you are interested in me, just send me mail. I will reply for sure if you are not robot or ADs :)
