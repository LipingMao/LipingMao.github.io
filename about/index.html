  <p>Glad someone can open this page, I did not leave any place to let people give their comments or message as I do not like others comment on me, what a XXXX guy :-) </p>
  <p>This blog is only for me to record something I learn. I'm a technical guy who is interested in Network, IaaS, Container. </p>

  <p>For last 3 years, I worked around openstack from Folsom to Mitaka, I was ATC in neutron, recently I focus on Kuryr. </p>
  <p>If you are interested in me, just send me mail. I will reply for sure if you are not robot or ADs :) </p>
