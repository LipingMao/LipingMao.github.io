---



## Background 

This is my last week in Cisco System and the first week to work together with new groups in a start up company. I decide to record some of my feeling and things I learn, that is why I decide to have a weekly based summary.

I am not sure if I will update this serial blogs on time, but hopefully, I will. The thing I will focus in this serial is my personal view of how a startup build from 0. This is an unknown journey and interested for me. So let's start...



## Weekly Summary

This is the second week, I worked in new start up. A lot of new things we cover this week:

Technically:

- Rain introduce the GSLB login in net easy. Couple of new things 
  - Keepalived for multiple server for different vip.
  - OSPF for Nginx VIP for HA.
  - Geo DNS.
  - Speed up for small network Vender in China.
  - Speed up for oversea customer.
- PaaS API Auth design:
  - APP id / APP Secret design
- Tencent Cloud basic
- Java, Java, Java ...



Non-Technically:

* Form a team is not easy, especially , we need the team have different knowledge base. So that it can work from scratch. It will not work if all member has similar background.
* How to let all person on the same page is not easy.
* avoid over design and be clear about the key points of your product.



Hello world, Hello Pano.
