title: WebRTC -- Demo 15
---

The teapot is drawn on the canvas element using WebGL. A stream is captured from the canvas element using its captureStream() method and set as the srcObject of the video element.

```
'use strict';

// Call main() in demo.js
main();

const canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');
const video = document.querySelector('video');

const stream = canvas.captureStream();
video.srcObject = stream;
```
