title: Startup -- Week 2 (2019/08/26 - 2019/09/01)

## Weekly Summary

This is the third week, the biggest in my mind is I did not actually fully understand what make webex success, and what I can learn from there.


Technically:

- Golang
- HTTP
- Nginx


Non-Technically:

- The challenge is depended on us to build 0.1-1.0 version, so the knowledge of team should be cross.
