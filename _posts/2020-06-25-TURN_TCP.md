title: WebRTC -- WebRTC Over TCP
---

Forcing WebRTC media over TCP is not recommended, its just a fallback option for strict firewalls.

If you specify ?transport=tcp in TURN urls, then WebRTC client will connect to TURN Server over TCP.
Clients will send STUN requests over TCP to allocate relay candidates (As far as i know, currently chrome/firefox only request UDP relay candidates).

To force strict TCP via TURN server:
```
Use only TURN url with ?transport=tcp
Specify iceTransportPolicy:"relay", so that all media will flow via TURN
```

After exchanging the relay candidates(udp) between peerConnections, the media path will be as below

```
P1 <--TCP--> P1TURN <--UDP--> P2TURN <--TCP--> P2
```

If both P1TURN & P2TURN are always same, then you can choose TURN relay path as LAN/lo interface i.e. you will get UDP relay candidates with LAN/lo IP.
