title: Startup -- Week 1 (2019/08/19 - 2019/08/25)
---



## Background and Why

This is my last week in Cisco System and the first week to work together with new groups in a start up company. I decide to record some of my feeling and things I learn, that is why I decide to have a weekly based summary.

I am not sure if I will update this serial blogs on time, but hopefully, I will. The thing I will focus in this serial is my personal view of how a startup build from 0. This is an unknown journey and interested for me. So let's start...



## Weekly Summary

We start the journey on 2019/08/22. Let me have a brief introduce about the team. We have one founder(CEO) and 15 persons core team. Most member in this team are senior. We have a relative clear target about what to do. And CEO has got Angel investion, we have team in HZ(10) and SZ(5). Great week here, hopefully we would see more things in the couple of weeks later.



Meanwhile , here is couple of things I have never think before, these things will help me in the future:

- Basic things to form a company
  - How to get angel invention and (Still unknown for me, but this is actually not that important for me now, know more people and make yourself more famous may help you in this)
  - How to register a company?  (Unknown for me)
  - We need to figure out a Work Place for people. There is a lot of "Shared Spaces", those place are very good for a startup, you just need to pay about 4000-7000 RMB per month, you can get about 10 persons room in SuZhou.
  - Personal PC for each of person. We got 13 inch (i5 + 16G RAM + 256G Disk) Mac Pro. I was using 15 inch in Cisco, personally I love this 13 Inch PC, it is much light than 15 inch PC, and it is OK for me to do daily job, I like it. ðŸ¤£
  - We have nothing, so we need to build our basic development environment from 0. Harry , Ethan and me build the basic development support system on the cloud, here is what we did :
  - We get AWS environment in China. (AWS in China only open for Company , it is not open for personal, so you have to registered a company, then you could start there.)
  - AWS Price stuff is a place which I have never thinked about. This is critical thing for a start up. Well, we never think about money in Cisco, we just use the best one~ 
- Build basic IT system: 
  - LDAP
  - Gitlab
  - Wiki
  - OpenVPN
  - E-MAIL
  - DNS(AWS China do not support it)

- about Team
  - When you start to form a team, the initial member(core member) better to can do things immidately, so the person is better match the job. And the person who in core team is better to know different things, for example in SuZhou team, I am familar with Cloud, Infra, Network stuff, but I know nothing about java, go. Harry is familar with Big data, Java. John can do thing around go, java, HPC.
  - We only have one founder and with 14 members, I think this is good for long term.
- Make sure , we are start up
  - We need to save money... such as traveling, PC, work place, cloud, meal and OT work. It is OK for me. And this understand by all core members.
- A lot of aspect, I have never think about before , and I missed a lot of good things in Webex which I can learn. I worked in Cloud Service, but I did not have a full picture how and why make Webex good to end user, I did not get familar with Webex core service and understand how it works (at least overview). I did not get fully understand how Infra works in Webex, such as DNS, LB stuff. Know all these things as a full picture is good for a start up company.  But it is never to late to understand people know nothing, I will try to have a full picture about this when we run this start up.



A lot of new things and challenges, just do it and have a try~
