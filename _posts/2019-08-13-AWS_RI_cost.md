title: AWS -- RI cost
---

## Background

> AWS OD(On-Demand) instance cost is very high, basically those instances should not have a long life(for example, just use them for couple of days or months). If you are going to use the instance for long time(for example, 1 year or couple of years), you should purchase RI(Reserved Instance). It will save 60%-80% of the cost.
